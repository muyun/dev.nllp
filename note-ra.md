    - read the paper on legal-bert

    - some programming

* insight
    - clearly thinking: if you wanna think better, **giving more time to think**, and hone your understanding of the problem

* research:
    - **mindset**: **learning from failure to continue exploring the unknown*** is a brodadly useful mindset
        + science proceeds because researchers do all they can to **disprove their hypotheses** rathe than prove them right

    - look for **important problems**, meaning ones with **answers that matter to humankind**

    - **getting started**
        + it's **unnecessary** for scientists to spend an enormous amount of time learning techniques and supporting disciplines before beginning research

        + the best way to learn what we need to know is **by getting started**, then **picking up new knowledge as it proves itself necessary**.
        the great incentive to learning a new skill or supporting discipline is **needing to use it**
        when there's an urgent need, we learn faster and avoid unnecessary learning

        +  build confidence **by doing something concrete and seeing a visible manifestation of our labors**.
        the best scientists **begin with the understanding** that they can never know anything and, besides, **learning needs to be a lifelong process**        "**psychologically most important to get results**, even if they are not original"

    - effective collaboration
        + advocate for being open about ideas and doing away with secrecy
        +  **tell everyone everything you know**

    - never to fool yourself

    - the best creative environment
        + creativity rises from **tranquility**
        + creativity is upported by **a safe environement**,
        one in which you can **share and question openly**, and be heard
        with **compassion and a desire to understand**
