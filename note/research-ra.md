##### Reading a paper  
* the abstract / title  -> check **whether the paper is interesting or not**  
    - why the paper is interesting according to the authors  
    - what are the main results in the paper  

* the figures and the figure captions  -> **the "story"** the authors try to tell  
    - **how this method stack up** to previous approaches  

* the introduction  
    - skip  

* **the methods/supplemental material**  -> this is most of the real 'science' is  
    - HOW  
        + how they do the experiments  
        + how they analyze the data  
        + how they support the conclusions  
    - Notice   
        + clearly which data they collected?  
        + clearly what analysis they performed on those data?  
        + where I can get the data and code to verify it  
        + **every step in a process** or skip over steps and reference previous papers  

* the results  
    - any **claim/idea** that missed from the figures  
    - make sure the results seem well justified to what did in the methods secton  


* Conclusions  
    - skip
